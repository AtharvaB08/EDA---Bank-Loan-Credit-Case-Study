# EDA---Bank-Loan-Credit-Case-Study

Here's a README file you can use for your GitHub repository:

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a credit dataset. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and insights that can help financial institutions evaluate loan applicants, especially those with limited or no credit history. This analysis is essential for predicting which applicants may have difficulties in repaying their loans, thereby assisting in more informed lending decisions.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. `EDA - Credit Case Study.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for the EDA performed on the credit dataset. It includes various stages such as data understanding, data cleaning, univariate and multivariate analysis, and the identification of key patterns and trends.
- **Key Sections**:
  - **Data Understanding**: Initial exploration to comprehend the structure, types, and quality of the data.
  - **Data Cleaning**: Steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.
  - **Univariate Analysis**: Examines the distribution of single variables, focusing on aspects such as the marital status of applicants and income distributions.
  - **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigates relationships between multiple variables, such as income vs. occupation and credit vs. education.

### 2. `Atharva Bhapkar_Exploratory Data Analysis.pptx`
- **Description**: This PowerPoint presentation summarizes the findings from the EDA, highlighting the most significant insights and trends discovered. It is intended to provide a clear and concise overview of the analysis results.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - **Marital Status of Applicants**: Most applicants are married, followed by single/not married individuals.
  - **Occupation vs. Payment Difficulties**: Few applicants from various occupations face payment difficulties, with laborers being the most common.
  - **Income vs. Occupation**: While laborers have above-average income, they still represent a large portion of credit applicants.
  - **Education vs. Income and Credit**: Higher education is associated with both higher income and larger credit amounts, with significant income disparities based on gender.
